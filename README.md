# Weather App

## This is the app they suggest on the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) after the API module in the JavaScript curriculum.

It's a simple weather app that uses an API from the [Open Weather Map](https://www.openweathermap.org)

- First search for the city--spelling counts--and click "Go"
- Click on either Celsius or Fahrenheit to switch
- You'll get the time and date, as well as an icon and a description of weather conditions

There's all there is to it.

Please click below for a live demo.
