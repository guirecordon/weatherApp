# Weather App

## This is the app they suggest on the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) after the API module in the JavaScript curriculum.

It's a simple weather app that uses an API from the [Open Weather Map](https://www.openweathermap.org)

- First search for the city--spelling counts--and click "Go"
- Click on either Celsius or Fahrenheit to switch

There's all there is to it.
